# Building a Scalable Web3 dApp with AWS and Blockchain Integration

## Overview
This guide walks you through building a decentralized application (dApp) that integrates blockchain technology with AWS services to create a scalable, secure infrastructure. By combining smart contracts with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and IPFS, this project demonstrates how to automate cloud processes while ensuring decentralized data storage.

## Architecture
The architecture of this dApp consists of the following components:

- **Blockchain:** Smart contracts deployed on Ethereum to handle decentralized logic.
- **AWS Lambda:** Automates backend processes triggered by blockchain events.
- **Amazon API Gateway:** Serves as the API interface between blockchain and AWS services.
- **IPFS:** Provides decentralized data storage, ensuring immutability and accessibility.
- **Amazon S3:** Used for additional off-chain data storage.

## Project Components
### 1. Smart Contracts
The core of the dApp is built using Solidity smart contracts. This project implements an ERC-20 token contract that allows users to mint and transfer tokens.

#### Token.sol (ERC-20 Token Contract)
```solidity
function mint(address to, uint256 amount) public {
    require(hasRole(MINTER_ROLE, msg.sender), "Caller is not a minter");
    _mint(to, amount);
}
```

#### Deployment
1. Open [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Copy and paste the `Token.sol` contract.
3. Compile the contract using the Solidity Compiler.
4. Deploy the contract to a testnet (e.g., Sepolia or Ropsten) using MetaMask.
5. Interact with the contract using functions like `mint()` and `transfer()`.

### 2. AWS Integration

To scale the dApp efficiently, AWS services handle backend logic and event-based automation.
AWS Lambda Setup (Node.js)
Navigate to AWS Lambda and create a new function.
Select "Author from Scratch" and choose Node.js as the runtime.
Paste the following code to listen for blockchain events:


```node.js

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    try {
        const transactionDetails = JSON.parse(event.body);
        console.log("Transaction details received:", transactionDetails);
        
        return {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Lambda executed successfully' })
        };
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error processing transaction:", error);
        return {
            statusCode: 500,
            body: JSON.stringify({ message: 'Internal Server Error' })
        };
    }
};
```

#### API Gateway Setup
1. Create a new API in **Amazon API Gateway**.
2. Link it to the AWS Lambda function.
3. Define API methods to handle requests from the frontend or smart contracts.

---
### 3. Frontend (Optional)
The frontend will interact with the deployed smart contracts using **web3.js** or **ethers.js**. It will:
- Connect to MetaMask.
- Display token balances.
- Allow users to execute transactions (e.g., mint, transfer tokens).

## Deployment Steps
### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/empty-bytes/web3-aws.git
cd web3-aws
```

### Deploy Smart Contracts
1. Navigate to the `smart_contracts/` folder.
2. Open `Token.sol` in Remix.
3. Compile and deploy to a testnet.
4. Save the contract address for further integration.

### Set Up AWS Services
1. Deploy the AWS Lambda function.
2. Set up API Gateway and link it to Lambda.
3. Configure necessary IAM roles and permissions.

## Challenges & Learnings
- **Security:** Implementing strict access controls to ensure only authorized users can invoke Lambda functions.
- **API Configuration:** Properly configuring API Gateway to communicate seamlessly with decentralized smart contracts.
- **Scalability:** Using AWS services to handle backend automation efficiently.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how Web3 dApps can integrate with AWS to create scalable and automated decentralized systems. By leveraging **smart contracts, AWS Lambda, and IPFS**, you can develop a secure, decentralized infrastructure with cloud-based automation.
